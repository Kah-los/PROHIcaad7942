    The final project aims to apply data science concepts and skills on a medical case study that you and your team select from a public data source.
    The project assumes that you bring the technical Python skills from previous courses (DSHI: Data Science for Health Informatics),
    as well as the analytical skills to argue how and why specific techniques could enhance the problem domain related to the selected dataset.

        This mini-project summarizes my end-to-end workflow from the DSHI course.
        I cleaned and explored a patient-level dataset, engineered features (age groups, BMI bands, hypertension/diabetes flags),
        and built a baseline logistic regression and a tree-based model to predict stroke risk.
        I evaluated models with stratified cross-validation and focused on recall and AUC to prioritize case finding.
        Insights were translated into an interactive dashboard for descriptive trends and simple â€˜what-ifâ€™ exploration.
        While the app here uses synthetic data, the structure mirrors the original workflow: inputs on the left, 
        live charts and key figures on the right, and a table preview.
        The goal is to demonstrate clear, reproducible steps from data preparation to communication of results.
